This program, written in python v3.5.1 functions as a model viewer for files of the .obj format. A file named 'usethis' placed in the same directory as the application will be read and displayed as a flat colored object. Once displayed the model is easily rotated using three sliders, one for each axis, and scaled by an additional slider.
